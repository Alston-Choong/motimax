## ‚ú® Core Experience

- **Personalised onboarding**  
  Preferred name, pronouns, date of birth, and secure sign-in (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, or email) with multi-factor authentication. Choose theme (dark, light, neon, or system), language (EN-US, EN-UK, ZH-CN), and session length (5 to 20 minutes).

- **Optional personality insight**  
  Start with validated frameworks such as Big Five, MBTI, VIA, DISC, or HEXACO, or jump straight into chosen growth domains.

- **Five-stage lessons with dynamic tasks**  
  Each lesson follows five stages with 3 to 5 multimedia activities per stage: mini-games, role-play, simulated conversations, Q&A with AI avatars, short inspirational videos, reflective journaling or voice notes, and mindfulness with music or soundscapes. Feedback is instant and supportive.

- **Create and share motivation**  
  Each stage completion unlocks a customisable quote tile or short clip that can be animated and narrated. Control font, colour, background, voice, language, and aspect ratio. Export is ready for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, and X.

- **Themes and languages**  
  Dark, light, vibrant, and system themes. Bilingual UI and content (EN-US, EN-UK, ZH-CN) with easy extensibility.
