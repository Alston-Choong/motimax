## üîÑ Development Process

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **pnpm** 8+
- **Git** for version control
- **GitHub account** for collaboration

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/motimax.git
   cd motimax
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Fill in your configuration values
   ```
5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Commit your changes** using conventional commits
5. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request

## üèóÔ∏è Coding Standards

We maintain high code quality standards to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability.

### Code Style

- **Prettier** for code formatting (automated on commit)
- **ESLint** for code quality and consistency
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **2 spaces** for indentation
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Trailing commas** where valid

### Configuration Files

- `.prettierrc.json` - Prettier configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint rules and plugins
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler options

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use **Husky** and **lint-staged** to run checks before commits:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ],
    "*.{json,md,yml,yaml}": [
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Code Quality Checks

- **TypeScript compilation** must pass without errors
- **ESLint** must pass with zero warnings
- **Prettier** formatting must be applied
- **Unit tests** must pass (when available)
- **Build process** must complete successfully

## üåø Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow model:

### Branch Types

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, always deployable
- **`feature/`** - New features and enhancements
- **`bugfix/`** - Bug fixes for current release
- **`hotfix/`** - Critical fixes for production issues
- **`docs/`** - Documentation updates
- **`refactor/`** - Code refactoring without functional changes
- **`chore/`** - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

### Naming Conventions

- Use **lowercase** with **hyphens** for separation
- Be **descriptive** but **concise**
- Include **issue number** when applicable

**Examples:**
- `feature/user-onboarding-flow`
- `bugfix/auth-redirect-loop-123`
- `docs/update-contributing-guide`
- `hotfix/security-vulnerability-456`

## üí¨ Commit Style

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear, structured commit messages that enable automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **`feat`** - New features
- **`fix`** - Bug fixes
- **`docs`** - Documentation changes
- **`style`** - Code style changes (formatting, no logic changes)
- **`refactor`** - Code refactoring
- **`perf`** - Performance improvements
- **`test`** - Adding or updating tests
- **`build`** - Build system or dependency changes
- **`ci`** - CI/CD configuration changes
- **`chore`** - Other maintenance tasks
- **`revert`** - Reverting previous commits

### Scopes (Optional)

- `auth` - Authentication and authorization
- `ui` - User interface components
- `api` - API endpoints and services
- `db` - Database schema and queries
- `i18n` - Internationalization
- `deps` - Dependencies

### Examples

```bash
# Simple feature
git commit -m "feat: add user profile avatar upload"

# Bug fix with scope
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve OAuth redirect loop issue"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: redesign lesson completion flow

REAKING CHANGE: The lesson completion API now requires a completion timestamp."

# Documentation update
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation for lesson endpoints"

# Dependency update
git commit -m "chore(deps): update @supabase/supabase-js to v2.38.0"
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use **present tense** ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use **imperative mood** ("fix bug" not "fixes bug")
- Keep the first line **under 72 characters**
- Reference **issues and PRs** when applicable
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
